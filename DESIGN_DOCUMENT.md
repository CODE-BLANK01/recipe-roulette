The main goal of RecipeRoulette is to solve meal monotony while reducing grocery waste.

The application uses:

- **Node.js + Express** for backend routing  
- **MongoDB Atlas** for database storage  
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6 Modules)** for client-side rendering  
- **Two MongoDB collections:**  
  - `recipes`  
  - `inventory`  

No frontend frameworks or ORMs were used.
